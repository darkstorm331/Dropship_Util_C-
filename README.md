# Dropship_Util_C-
An application created in C# which uses eBay's API to list products from a Dropshipping site called Tekbox

I created this in my spare time as a way to create some extra money outside of work. This program connects to the TekBox website and pulls
an XML feed of their products. It then goes through this and lists them to eBay using the eBay API.

This was a good project for me to improve my knowledge of C#
